Sentiment Analysis implemented on movie reviews dataset.

In this project, I used the Bag of Words (BoW) model for sentiment analysis, which is an important part of Natural Language Processing (NLP). To determine the best approach for predicting sentiment, I investigated the effectiveness of various text classification models, such as the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, the Random Forest classifier, and the Logistic Regression model. I conducted data preprocessing using advanced natural language processing techniques and used these models to classify reviews as positive or negative.

I used hyperparameter tuning to optimise model performance and ensure accurate predictions, demonstrating my knowledge in fine-tuning machine learning models. The chosen evaluation method, cross-validation K-fold, reinforced the models' robustness.

The primary goal of this project was to develop a model that could accurately predict the sentiment of upcoming reviews. As a result of these efforts, I significantly increased the model's accuracy score, demonstrating my dedication to delivering results in the field of Natural Language Processing.
